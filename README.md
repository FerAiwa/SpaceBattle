# Spaceship Battle
3rd challenge at Hack a BOS course! A space war simulator! ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ®

## Live Demo
[Spaceship Battle v1.0 ðŸ‘¾](https://feraiwa.github.io/spaceBattle/)
### Important note: Use browser console to see the logger!
While I integrate logger with the UI, ... check the combat log with the *browser dev tools -> console*

### First release: 03/04

This is just a simple beta for a module-ending exercise. 
Â· The [basic rules](https://github.com/FerAiwa/starBattle/blob/master/ejercicio.final.md) (spanish).

I blended and expanded some of them to have some extra fun while developing it. 
I LOVE videogame design, so after I took my pencil and start drawing some ideas, I realy couldnÂ´t stop myself)

### Add-ons
This version of the spaceship battle has some extra features like:
* Special Units: 
  - **Medical Spaceships**: They look for ally targets and restore/boost their shield. (*Vitalis & Renovatio I*)
* Config (*can be edited in the main.js file*)
  * 2+ extra players: It should allow you to play as many as you want. (The UI would probably look ugly, do)
  - Extra ships: Edit the number in RULES.typelimit to get more ships.
  - Resize battlefield: Same for RULES.battlefieldSize. It will always result in a square battlefield. 2n
  - Game Speed: Adjust the rhytm for the logger messages. (seconds)

* 4 battleship types of diferent points.
* A random army generator.
