# Spaceship Battle
3rd challenge at Hack a BOS course! A space war simulator!


### Important note:
Logger needs integration with the UI, do... but the full combat log is visible in the browser dev tools -> console 

### First release: 03/04

This is just a simple beta for a module-ending exercise. 
· The [basic rules](https://github.com/FerAiwa/starBattle/blob/master/ejercicio.final.md) were this.

I blended and expanded some of them to have some extra fun while developing it. 
I LOVE videogame design, as I started drawing some ideas, I couldn´t stop myself)

This version of the spaceship battle has some extra features like:
* Medical Spaceships: Look for allied targets and restore/boost their shield. (*Vitalis & Renovatio I*)
* Extra players: You can edit the starting players in the main.js file. It should allow you to play as many as you want.
(The UI would probably look ugly, do)
* Extra ships: In main.js file, edit the number in the RULES to get more ships.
* 4 battleship types of diferent points.
* A random army generator.
