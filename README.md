### First release: 03/04

This is a beta for a module-ending exercise.
Â· The [basic rules](https://github.com/FerAiwa/starBattle/blob/master/ejercicio.final.md) (spanish).

I blended and expanded some of them to have some extra fun while developing it.
I LOVE videogame design, so after I took my pencil and start drawing some ideas, I realy couldnÂ´t stop myself)

### Add-ons

This version of the spaceship battle has some extra features like:

- Special Units:
  - **Medical Spaceships**: They look for ally targets and restore/boost their shield. (_Vitalis & Renovatio I_)
- Config (_can be edited in the main.js file_)

  - 2+ extra players: It should allow you to play as many as you want. (The UI would probably look ugly, do)

  * Extra ships: Edit the number in RULES.typelimit to get more ships.
  * Resize battlefield: Same for RULES.battlefieldSize. It will always result in a square battlefield. 2n
  * Game Speed: Adjust the rhytm for the logger messages. (seconds)

- 4 battleship types with increasing stats and several choices.
- A random army generator.
